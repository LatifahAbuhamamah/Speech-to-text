# Speech-to-text
A webpage has been created to aid in the communication between humans and robots. This webpage allows users to speak and have their speech translated into text that the robots can understand. The spoken words are recorded, translated, and then saved in a database. The webpage also includes two buttons, one for downloading the translated text and another for cleaning up any unnecessary data.
